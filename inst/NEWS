CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.2
-------------------------

Modified the logicle and the inverse logicle transformation to make use of the 
C++ library provided by Wayne Moore et al.

Added a function estimateLogicle to automatically estimate the logicle
transformation parameters given a flowFrame and the channels to be transformed
as input.

Modified the inverseLogicleTransfom function to take the output of a 
logicleTransform function as input.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.21.1
-------------------------
add TEXT segment parser in readFCStext function for FCS3 when the delimiter characters existing inside of
keyword values. Note this parser require all keywords and their values to be non-empty, which conforms to FCS3 standard

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.21.5
-------------------------
add .readFCSdataRaw routine to read FCS containing bit-packed integer data (with odd-bitwidth like 9,11 instead of 8,16,32,64)
.Currently the bit-wise manipulation is done within R,it can be moved to C if speed issue becomes a problem in the future.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.23.2
-------------------------
add new classes "filters", "filtersList" to allow flowViz to plot multiple filters/gates for one flowFrame
 
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.23.3
-------------------------
add argument "emptyValue" to read.FCS API so that parser can still work correctly when either cases below occurs : 
1.there is double-delimiter in keyword values (sometime like \\c:\\path\\...) 
2.there is empty keyword value  (\\keyword1\\value1\\keyword2\\\\keyword3)
